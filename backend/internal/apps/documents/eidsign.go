// E-ID signing is not a form the platform fills in on the citizen's behalf. eID
// Mongolia has no document-signing endpoint: what it has is an approval a citizen
// gives on their own registered device, with their own credentials, against a
// display text we choose. That approval *is* the signature, so the ceremony is
//
//	start  — push "sign <document>" to the citizen's eID app
//	poll   — wait for them to approve, refuse, or let it expire
//
// and the signature is recorded the moment the approval comes back COMPLETE.
//
// The provider mints the session id, so the pairing of session to document can
// only be written after the push. It is written with a context that outlives the
// caller's, because that pairing is what stops an approval given for one document
// from being presented as a signature on another — a citizen must never be able to
// approve something nothing can attach their signature to. It is single-use, and
// it is spent in the same transaction as the signature it produces.

// signSessionGrace is how far past eID's own deadline a session is still
// accepted, so a small clock difference between us and the provider does not
// throw away an approval the citizen gave in time.
const signSessionGrace = 2 * time.Minute

// signSessionBackstop bounds a session eID gave NO deadline for. eID states none
// for a push session — it decides when one dies and says so with EXPIRED — so
// there is nothing to count down, only a limit past which an approval id sitting
// in a log must stop being redeemable.
//
// It is set well beyond any real ceremony on purpose. A push session was measured
// still RUNNING nine minutes after it was created, and treating a shorter figure
// as a deadline is what made the sign-in flow walk away from sessions eID was
// still waiting on: a citizen who takes longer than that to unlock a phone, find
// the notification and enter a PIN loses the approval they were about to give.

// provider states none.
//
// It used to invent "two minutes from now" in that case. eID gives no deadline
// for a push session, so that figure was not a deadline but a cutoff of our own
// making — and it would have thrown away an approval the citizen was still in the
