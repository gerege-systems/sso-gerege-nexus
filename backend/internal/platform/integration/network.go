// Whoever can save a connector chooses an address this server then connects to,
// with this server's network position. That is the whole shape of a server-side
// request forgery: a tenant administrator — who is not the operator of the
// deployment — types http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ into a webhook
// target and the platform fetches the cloud instance's credentials for them.
// The status and the provider's own words come back through last_error and the
// delivery log, so it is not even blind.
//
// The check that matters is at dial time, not at save time. A hostname resolves
// when the connection is made, so a name that answered with a public address
// when the form was submitted can answer with 127.0.0.1 an hour later, and a
// redirect can land anywhere. Control runs after resolution, on the concrete
// address, on every attempt and on every hop — which is the only place the
// decision is about where the socket is actually going.

// allowPrivateEnv lets a deployment turn the guard off.
//
// A self-hosted installation whose subscribers genuinely live on the same
// private network is a real configuration, and refusing to serve it would push
// the operator to a worse workaround. It is off by default because the
// deployments that need it know they do.

// newHTTPClient builds the client every outbound call in this package uses.

// One consequence to know about: the transport keeps ProxyFromEnvironment, and
// a dial through a proxy is a dial to the proxy. A deployment that reaches the
