// Package resilience holds the load shedder, and only the load shedder.
//
// It used to also hold an SRE-style adaptive circuit breaker, an exponential
// backoff retry and a singleflight. All three were removed rather than wired
// up, because the reasons to wire them had already been answered better
// elsewhere:
//
//   - Every outbound client already carries a timeout — integration, gerege,
//     emailverify and eid each set one on their http.Client.
//   - Delivery already retries, in integration.deliver, against a bounded
//     backoff schedule and only for failures attemptDelivery classifies as
//     retryable. The generic DoWithRetry retried everything, so putting it in
//     front of a 400 would have sent the same rejected request three times.
//   - The breaker and the singleflight had never executed outside their own
//     tests, and the singleflight leaked: a panic inside the guarded function
//     skipped both wg.Done and the map delete, so every later caller for that
//     key blocked forever. Introducing that to the eID, DAN and payment paths
//     would have been the opposite of resilience.
//
// If a breaker is wanted later, it should arrive attached to the call it
// guards. An unused one in a package named "resilience" reads, to anyone
// scanning for it, as a protection this platform already has.
