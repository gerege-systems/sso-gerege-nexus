// Why this is platform furniture rather than an app module, and why it sends
// nothing itself.
//
// Contacts wants an address proven before it trusts it, Documents wants it
// before a signing link leaves for an outsider, and Gov Services wants it
// before it answers a citizen at one. That is one capability, so it lives in
// the platform and every module reaches it the same way.
//
// The mail itself is somebody else's problem on purpose. Delivering mail that
// arrives is not a matter of holding an SMTP password: it is SPF, DKIM, DMARC,
// reverse DNS and a sending reputation, maintained continuously. enigma.mn runs
// that, so this platform holds no mailbox credential, composes no message and
// owns no sender address. It asks for a link to be sent and finds out when it
// was followed.
//
// What stays here is what only this platform can know: which module asked, for
// whom, why, and whether the person came back.
