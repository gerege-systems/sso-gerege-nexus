/**
 * One screen's worth of server data: fetch it on mount, hold it, refetch on
 * demand, and remember whether the last attempt failed.
 *
 * Every list screen had written this out by hand, and the copies agreed on
 * everything that matters, including the part that is easy to get wrong: a load
 * that FAILED must not leave the screen holding an empty array, because "no
 * documents yet" is a claim about the tenant and a tenant with twelve contracts
 * in the queue would be told it has none. `failed` is what a screen renders
 * instead of that claim, and it is cleared only by a load that actually
 * succeeded.
 *
 * `setData` is exposed because these screens edit rows in place — a checkbox
 * toggled before Save is pressed — and refetching the table to show one keypress
 * would throw away the edits made to every other row.
 */
/**
 * Runs `load` once, when the component mounts.
 *
 * This is what the screens meant by `useEffect(() => { load(); }, [])`, which
 * the exhaustive-deps rule flagged in every one of them — correctly, because
 * `load` is written inline and closes over state that a later render replaces.
 * Listing it as a dependency is not the fix either: a new identity per render
 * would refetch on every render.
 *
 * So the callback is read through a ref, which is written after each render.
 * The effect then genuinely has no reactive dependencies rather than being told
 * to ignore the ones it has, and a reload triggered later runs the current
 * version of the callback rather than the one captured at mount.
 *
 * Use this only for the load a screen does on arrival. Anything that should
 * re-run when a value changes belongs in an effect that names that value.
