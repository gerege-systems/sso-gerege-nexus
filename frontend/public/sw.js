/*
 * Gerege Nexus — service worker.
 *
 * This exists to make the platform installable and to give it something to show
 * when the network is gone. It is deliberately the smallest thing that does
 * that, because a service worker on a platform holding tenant data is a cache
 * sitting in front of somebody else's documents.
 *
 * The rule it is built around: nothing that belongs to a person is ever stored.
 *
 *   /api/*        never touched — not read from the cache, not written to it
 *   navigations   network first, and the offline page only when the network
 *                 failed outright
 *   /_next/static content-addressed by the build, so the same URL is always the
 *                 same bytes and caching it cannot go stale
 *   icons, brand  the same
 *   everything else passes straight through
 *
 * A shared machine is the case that decides this. Two people sign in to the
 * same browser an hour apart; if a single API response were cached, the second
 * could be handed the first one's data by a worker that knows nothing about
 * sessions. So the worker is not told to be careful with API responses — it is
 * told not to look at them.
